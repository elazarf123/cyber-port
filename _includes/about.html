        <!-- The only thing you have to edit here is the first sentence. Replace the years of experience and industry type with your own info. -->
        <p>I am a Cybersecurity Professional with 3+ years of experience in healthcare IT security, specializing in SIEM operations, incident response, and HIPAA compliance. Currently working as a Healthcare IT Support & Network Administrator at Alorica (supporting CVS), where I monitor system logs, investigate security anomalies, and manage access controls across high-security platforms.
          My expertise includes real-world Splunk (SIEM) experience from my time as a Health Data Security & System Coordinator at the Department of Public Health, where I improved incident response times by 25% and strengthened system resilience by 30% through proactive threat detection and risk assessments. I also implemented Linux-based access management controls at AT&T that reduced the attack surface by 15%.
          I hold a Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and am actively pursuing CompTIA Security+ certification. My hands-on experience with log analysis, incident triage, vulnerability management, and secure application development—combined with deep knowledge of HIPAA compliance—positions me to excel in SOC Analyst and Security Operations roles.</p>
